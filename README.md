# Verification of GoJournal

[![CI](https://github.com/mit-pdos/gojournal-proof/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mit-pdos/gojournal-proof/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Program proofs for [go-journal](https://github.com/mit-pdos/go-journal), using [Perennial](https://github.com/mit-pdos/perennial).

Install dependencies with `opam install --deps-only .` and then compile with `dune build`.

Note: these proofs are built using the "old" version of Goose. They depend on the perennial-old.opam file.
